// receiveBuffer buffers incoming frames. It queues up available frames in a
// channel and makes sure that those are read in order when filling reader's
// buffers via the read() method. It also makes sure to send an ack whenever a
// queued frame has been fully read.
//
// In order to bound memory usage, the channel holds only <windowSize> frames,
// after which it starts back-pressuring. The sender knows not to send more
// than <windowSize> frames so as to prevent this. Once the sender receives an
// ACK from the receiver, it sends a subsequent frame and so on.
